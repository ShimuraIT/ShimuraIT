# Shimura - Big Project TBA

I like writing software that achieves big things simply.

What you need to know about me is that basically I'm a boy genius like Jimmy Neutron and you shouldn't even try to get at my level.

That's a joke. My work is dedicated to making you do incredible things. Because they are easy. Well that's not quite it either...

Blog coming soon.

Stuff I Done Did
---
- [Zeptext](https://github.com/ShimuraIT/Zeptext) — Lightest textboard ever, made in a couple hours for my blog.
- [Clay_Unicode](https://github.com/ShimuraIT/clay_unicode) — Ad-hoc modification to the [Clay UI Library](https://github.com/nicbarker/clay/) which as the name suggests adds unicode support.
